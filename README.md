# Discord Bot
This is a discord.py bot template.

## How to use the template
1. Download the code from the packages.
2. Fill out the `config.json` file.
3. Run the `imports.py` file if you are on windows. Support for more operating systems will be added later.
4. Execute the `commands.py` file.
5. Execute the `bot.py` file.

You should already have the discord bot on your server. It needs administrator and command permissions.
