# Discord Bot
This is a discord.py bot template.

## How to use the template
1. Download the code from the releases tab.
2. Fill out the `config.json` file.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your console (the `Bot` folder has to be open in you console).
4. Execute the `bot.py` file.

You should already have the discord bot on your server. It needs administrator and command permissions.
